# Employee Data

We have two datasets (Source - Kaggel): 
1) General employee information 
2) Employee survey results about job satisfaction, work life balance and environment satisfaction.

We will be carrying out SQL and Python queries on dataset to find co-relations between the two data sets.

I have majorly used joins and pivot tables in this project. I have demostated how to carry out the same quireies in SQL and Python.

I have used Microsoft Azure - Databricks platform to carry out the data procesing and mounted the data source from Storage Account in Azure.
